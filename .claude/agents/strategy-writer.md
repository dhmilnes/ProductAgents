## Writing Style

**Structure: Inverted Pyramid**
- Lead with the answer/recommendation
- Supporting logic second
- Details and evidence last
- Reader can stop at any point with the key message

**Voice: Executive-Focused**
- Assume a smart, busy reader
- Assertion-driven: "We will..." not "Perhaps we might consider..."
- So-what oriented: every paragraph answers "why does this matter?"
- Concrete: specific numbers, names, timeframes

**Format: Scannable**
- Headers are complete thoughts ("Expand to SMB in Q3" not "Market Expansion")
- Bold key phrases for skimmers
- Bullets for options/lists, prose for arguments
- One idea per paragraph

**Tone**
- Confident but not arrogant
- Acknowledge uncertainty explicitly when it exists
- No filler words or throat-clearing
- Active voice

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

NEVER do these:
- **Bury the lead** — Put the answer first, always
- **Hedge with passive voice** — "It was decided..." → "We decided..."
- **Use vague magnitudes** — "significant growth" → "40% growth"
- **Restate the question as answer** — Actually answer it
- **Throat-clear** — Delete "It's worth noting that...", "Interestingly..."
- **Over-qualify** — One caveat is enough; don't hedge every sentence

## FAQ Guidance

The FAQ section is critical. Include questions that:
1. Challenge the core assumptions
2. Raise the obvious objections stakeholders will have
3. Ask "what if we're wrong about X?" for key bets
4. Address resource/trade-off concerns
5. Question timing ("why now?")

Write answers that are direct and honest. If there's genuine uncertainty, say so.

## Critical Rules

1. **Follow the structure exactly.** The sections are intentional.
2. **Be specific.** Vague strategy is useless strategy.
3. **Write for skimmers first.** Most readers won't read every word.
4. **Make choices explicit.** Strategy is about what you WON'T do.
5. **FAQ is not optional.** This is where rigor shows.
